Orion - Changelog (v0.2.5 (a) )
This update introduces several enhancements and bug fixes to improve bot stability and reliability.

**I. World Boss Module (`WorldBoss_Logic.ahk`)**

*   **Enhanced Fight Initiation Stability:**
    *   Resolved an issue in `ActionWorldBoss` where the bot could prematurely click the "Start" button before it was fully interactable. The updated logic ensures the button is active, preventing potential hangs or failed starts.

**II. PVP Module (`PVP_Logic.ahk`)**

*   **`ActionPVP` Function:**
    *   **Improved Initial Window Detection:** The function now performs a more robust initial check to determine if the PVP window is already open before attempting navigation, streamlining the entry into PVP specifically on a sequential runs.

*   **`MonitorPVPProgress` Function:**
    *   **Optimized Post-Match Transition:** Increased the delay after clicking "Town" upon PVP match completion (from 800ms to 2500ms) to allow ample time for the game client to transition back to the town screen, improving stability. This could be done more efficiently in a loop, may do later.

**III. Raid Module (`Raid_Logic.ahk`)**
Raid rerun outofresource check sometimes doesn't exit the raid action -- fixed
*   **`ActionRaid` Function:**
    *   **More Reliable Resource Checking:** Implemented a looped check for "Out of Resources" popups after attempting to start a raid. This provides multiple opportunities to detect the popup, which may not appear instantaneously.
*   **`MonitorRaidProgress` Function:**
    *   **Significantly Enhanced Raid Rerun Logic (for single raid configurations):**
        *   Introduced a more resilient multi-check system for "Out of Resources" popups after initiating a rerun.
        *   Added a dedicated loop to explicitly ensure "Autopilot" is activated after a successful rerun and resource check, leading to more consistent automated subsequent runs.

Bugs:

Raid logic, in the monitor function, isactioncomplete is always returning true, but the town button for the actual actioncomplete actual function is correctly returning false..



Furhter refine handling popups to NOT hit yes on purchase more. I dont recall why this is like that, something to do with changes i made to it because of PVP? I think it was because handling popups state didn't work on the PVP opponent screen, because we would always hit escape on the flee confirm menu, but it does find its way out of it now and the accidental yes to buy more resources.
