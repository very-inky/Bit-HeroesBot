Concat the strings

example := "|<>hf8eyufa|<>huaguasu" where this one var can hold more than one OCR string so we can check for more than one on a single if statement


TO TEST. ActionWorldBoss flow, should properly detect tiers, logic for changing tiers NOT implemented, should properly detect and change difficulty, and worldboss using the efficient navigation method, MUCH FASTER! :D

TODO:
Worldboss logic seems solid,
right now the only bits non functional or not present: if your desired and selected tier do NOT match.
If tiers match, this will run.
	Pre worldboss dialogue, could likely reuse the raid functions for this.
	Highest and Lowest available config options present but not tested.
	Disconnect check in MonitorWorldBoss needs verified

Need to get rid of the first is worldboss window open check since it never will be open in this condition
