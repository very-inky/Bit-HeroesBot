# Bit Heroes Bot
Scripting meant to automate the Unity version of Bit Heroes. To replace ilpersi's now non-functional v46.5 Java based BHBot. The script uses a highly reliable image to text function to retrieve data on screen and act according to that. The script was reworked from scratch, no longer using AHK's native ImageSearch or PixelGetColor commands because they were unreliable. 

PVP scripting has been added and updated. PVP scripting is functional but missing a looping reconnect check as is Raid loop. So don't get disconnected!

TODO:Raid main should be good but need to add looped reconnect checks.
World boss next?

currently most of the script is disabled with commenting and we are just testing using a hotkey to check each portion as we go. Feel free to contribute, look around or tweak your own fork.
