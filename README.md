# Bit Heroes Bot
Scripting meant to automate the Unity version of Bit Heroes. To replace ilpersi's now non-functional v46.5 Java based BHBot. The script uses a highly reliable image to text function to retrieve data on screen and act according to that. The script was reworked from scratch, no longer using AHK's native ImageSearch or PixelGetColor commands because they were unreliable. 

THIS SCRIPT IS ACTIVELY BEING DEVELOPED
Most of the functionality of this script has been disabled as not to autorun and hotkeys have been bound to test things as needed. THIS IS NOT A RELEASE!!!!


TODO:
Implement auto disconnect, found a way to do it without looping it in main I think, need to start world boss functionality as well.
